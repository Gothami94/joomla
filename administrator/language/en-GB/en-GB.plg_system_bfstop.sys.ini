PLG_SYSTEM_BFSTOP="System - Brute Force Stop"
PLG_BFSTOP_DESC="<h2>Brute Force Stop</h2><div>This plugin provides means to avert Brute-Force-Attacks on your Joomla-Installation. For this purpose, the plugin stores information on failed login attempts, so that when reaching a configurable number of such failed login attempts the attacker's IP address can be blocked. Furthermore, you can configure notifications about failed logins and blocked IP addresses, as well as a variable delay for a failed login attempt.</div><br /><div><em>Don't forget to configure and publish the plugin after installation!</em><br />If you have any questions on the plugin, please visit the <a href='https://github.com/codeling/bfstop'>project site on github</a>. Should there be any problems when using the plugin, don't hesitate to report them in the <a href='https://github.com/codeling/bfstop/issues'>issue tracker</a>!</div><br /><div>In some parts, this plugin was inspired by the following plugins: Login Failed Log, Redirect Failed Logins and Ban IP Address/Range.
